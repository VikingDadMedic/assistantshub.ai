# Contributing to Roxie Hub

First off, thank you for considering contributing to Roxie Hub! It's people like you that make Roxie Hub such a great tool. We welcome contributions from everyone as part of our mission to democratize AI assistant development.

## Making Changes

- Create a topic branch from where you want to base your work.

  - To quickly create a topic branch: `git checkout -b my_fix_branch main`.

- Check for unnecessary whitespace with `git diff --check` before committing.
- Make sure your commit messages are in the proper format.
  - Start the commit message with a short summary (50 characters or less).
  - Provide a detailed description if necessary. Use markdown syntax in the description.
- Make sure you have added the necessary tests for your changes.
- Run all the tests to assure nothing else was accidentally broken.
